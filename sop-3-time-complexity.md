# Time Complexity Analysis

The function `improve_position` iterates over each position in the `position` array and performs several operations for each position. Let's break down the time complexity:

1. **Outer Loop**: The loop `for i in range(position.shape[0])` iterates over each position, so it runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of positions.

2. **Distance Calculation**:

   - `euclidean_distance(position[i, :-1], updt_position[i, :-1])` is called once per position, which is `O(d)` where `d` is the number of dimensions (excluding the fitness value).

   - `build_distance_matrix(position[:, :-1])` is called once before the loop, which is `O(n^2 * d)` because it calculates the distance between every pair of positions.

3. **Indexing and Random Choice**:

   - `np.where(dist_matrix[i, :] <= dist)[0]` is `O(n)` for each position.

   - `np.random.choice(idx)` and `np.random.choice(position.shape[0])` are `O(1)` operations.

4. **Inner Loop**: The loop `for j in range(len(min_values))` runs `d` times for each position, where `d` is the number of dimensions.

5. **Operations Inside Inner Loop**:

   - `np.clip(...)` is `O(1)` for each dimension.

   - `target_function(i_position[i, :-1])` is called once per position, which is `O(d)` assuming the target function is `O(d)`.

6. **Fitness Comparison**: The fitness comparison and assignment operations are `O(1)`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity of the `improve_position` function is:

- **Distance Matrix Calculation**: `O(n^2 * d)`

- **Outer Loop**: `O(n * (d + n + d)) = O(n * (2d + n)) = O(n^2 + nd)`

Thus, the dominant term is `O(n^2 * d)` due to the distance matrix calculation, making the overall time complexity of the function `O(n^2 * d)`.
