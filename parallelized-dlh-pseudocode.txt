# Improve Position
Copy population to i_position
Build distance matrix as dist_matrix
Parallel for each position:
	dist = euclidian_distance(position, updated_position)
	index = distance within dist_matrix
	Parallel for each dimension:
		Generate random value
		Choose random indices ix_1 and ix_2
		Update i_position with weighted difference
	Calculate fitness for i_position
	Compare fitness and update i_position
