1. The existing algorithm's alpha, beta, and delta wolves are initialized to zero  which might introduce bias, especially if the search space is large or not centered around zero.

Wolves Position:
	[0, 0, Fitness Value]

Simulation:
	To simulate, show that the default positions of alpha, beta, and delta is set to 0.

Objective: 
	Have an option to initialize wolves position randomly within the bounds to ensure a more diverse starting point and without bias





2. The algorithm faces inefficiency which means that it run longer than necessary even if the optimal solution is already achieved

Simulation: 
	To simulate, run a 10000 iteration problem then display the number of iteration in which the optimum solution was found.

Objective:
	Implement a method that stops the algorithm when optimal solution is found
