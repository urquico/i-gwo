# Possible Solutions

## SOP 1

- `Random Initialization:` Set the initial positions of alpha, beta, and delta wolves randomly within the search space boundaries. This could be achieved by setting their initial positions to random points, ensuring broader initial coverage of the search space.
- `Adaptive Initialization Based on Problem Characteristics:` Use statistical information (e.g., mean, median of feasible region or boundaries) to set starting points for alpha, beta, and delta wolves. For example, initializing wolves closer to the geometric center or randomly distributed within feasible boundaries.
- `Heuristic-Based Initialization:` If some problem-specific knowledge is available, incorporate it to place wolves nearer to regions with a higher likelihood of containing optimal solutions, balancing both global and local exploration.

## SOP 2

- `Convergence Check with Early Stopping:` Introduce a convergence criterion that halts the algorithm when improvements in solution quality fall below a defined threshold over a certain number of iterations. This could be based on observing the change in the best fitness value.
- `Adaptive Iteration Scheduling:` Use an adaptive iteration scheduler that gradually reduces the allowed iteration count if significant improvement is not detected within a preset number of consecutive iterations.
- `Dynamic Adjustment of Exploration and Exploitation Phases:` Implement mechanisms to detect when the wolves are consistently converging and switch to more intensive local search strategies when in proximity to an optimal solution, reducing unnecessary iteration overhead.

## SOP 3

- `Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:` Integrate dimensionality reduction methods, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce complexity in high-dimensional spaces without losing significant problem-specific information.
- `Divide-and-Conquer Strategy:` Divide the high-dimensional space into smaller, manageable subspaces where I-GWO can operate more efficiently, then combine solutions from these subspaces.
- `Sparse Update Mechanisms:` Instead of updating all dimensions, apply sparse updates to focus on dimensions with higher variability or significance. By selectively updating dimensions, the algorithm can maintain effectiveness without the computational burden associated with full-dimensional operations.
- `Variable Adaptation of DLH Strategy Complexity:` Adaptively reduce the number of dimensions or layers considered by DLH based on the remaining search space and current optimization convergence level.
