Possible Problems:

1. Handling of Start Initialization
	Current Implementation: 
		- The initial_variables function allows for a start_init parameter, 
		which is used to initialize part of the population. if start_init is provided, 
		it is combined with randomly generated individuals to fill the population.

	Issues:
		Bounds Check: check if the values of start_init are within the min_values and max_values bounds if not, they should be clipped or adjusted
		Dimensionality: verify if the start_init has the correct dimensionality to match the problem space

	Fixes: 
		- Create validation to ensure start_init is within bounds and has the correct shape.
		- Consider allowing start_init to be a percentage of the population size, dynamically adjusting the number of random individuals.

2. Initialization of Alpha, Beta, Delta
	Current Implementation:
		- Alpha, Beta, and Delta are initialized to zero vectors with an appended fitness value calculated using the target function.

	Issues:
		Bias: Initializing these positions to zero might introduce bias, especially if the search space is large or not centered around zero.

	Fixes:
		- Initialize alpha, beta, and delta randomly within the bounds to ensure a more diverse starting point.
		- Consider usin a small random pertubation around a central point if zero initialization is necessary for some reason.

3. Convergence Criteria
	Current Implementation:
		- The algorithm stops after a fixed number of iterations of if a target_value is reached.

	Issues:
		Premature Convergence: The algorithm might stop before finding the satisfactory solution if the criteria are too strict
		Inefficiency: The algorithm might run longer than necessary if the criteria are too lenient

	Fixes:
		- Implement additional criteria, such as stopping when the change in the best fitness value is below a threshold for a certain number of iterations.
		- Use adaptive criteria that adjust based on the progress of the optimization.

4. Randomness & Reproducibility
	Current Implementation:
		- The code uses a random numbers for initialization and position updates without setting a random seed.

	Issues: 
		Non-reproducibility: Results can vary between runs, making it difficult to compare outcomes or debug issues.

	Fixes:
		- Add an option to set a random seed for reproducibility.

5. Handling of Edge Cases
	Current Implementation:
		- The code assumes a minimum pack size of three for alpha, beta, and delta

	Issues:
		Small Pack SIzes: If pack_size is less than three, the code might fail of produce incorrect results

	Fixes: 
		- Add checks to ensure pack_size is at least three, or adjust the logic to handle smaller sizes
		- Consider what should happen if the population size is reduced dynamically during the optimization process.

6. Scalability
	Current Implementation:
		- The algorithm's performance might degrade with increasing dimensionality or population size.

		Issues: 
			Performance Bottlenecks: Certain operations like distance calculations or fitness evaluations might become slow for large problems.

		Fixes:
			- Profile the code to identify bottlenecks and optimize them, possibly by using more efficient data structures or parallel processing.
			- Consider using dimensionality reduction techniques if applicable to the problem domain.

7. Adaptive Parameters
	Current Implementation: 
		- The linear component a_linear_component decreases linearly over iterations

	Issues:
		Fixed Strategy: A linear decrease might not be optimal for all problems, potentially leading to suboptimal exploration or exploitation

	Fixes:
		- Experiment with non-linear or adaptive strategies for updating a_linear_component, such as exponential decay or feedback from the optimization process.
		- Consider using machine learning techniques to adaptively adjust parameters based on the optimization history
